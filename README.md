# Web Scrapping

  As part of this project, automated web scraping using *Splinter, HTML parsing with Beautiful Soup* as well as analysis of Mars data were performed. 
  
  In initial stage all news related Mars were scrapped using ***Beautiful Soup*** and stored in a Python dictionary format.
  
  In later part, Mars temperature data tramsmitted by *Curiosity* were scraped from a table in the website and stored as in a *panadas dataframe* format. This dataframe dataset was used for analysing *average monthly temperatures* at Mars as well as in estimating the *time taken by Mars to completed one circle around the sun in Earth days*.
